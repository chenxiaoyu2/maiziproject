Python interface to MySQL
=========================

mysqlclient is a fork of MySQL-python. It adds Python 3 support
and fixed many bugs.

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL_ database server for
Python. The design goals are:

- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]_
- Thread-safety
- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-5.5 through 5.7 and Python 2.7, 3.4+ are currently supported.
PyPy is supported too.

MySQLdb is `Free Software`_.
